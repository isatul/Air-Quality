# Air-Quality
Air quality is a critical aspect of urban life, influencing public health, environmental policies, and overall quality of life. Recently, I had the opportunity to analyze a comprehensive dataset on New York City's air quality, sourced from data.cityofnewyork.us. This dataset contained various columns such as Unique Id, Indicator ID, Name, Measure, Measure Info, Geo Type Name, Geo Join ID, Geo Place Name, Time Period, Start Date, Data Value, and Message. Through a meticulous process of data cleaning and visualization, I extracted meaningful insights that can inform both policymakers and the public.

# METHODOLOGY

Importing and Initial Visualization

The first step was to import the dataset into Microsoft Excel. To understand the distribution of the data values, I created a box and whisker chart and a scatter plot chart.I took a step into analyzing this dataset from data.cityofnewyork.us on the air quality in New York. 


Insights and Visualizations

Air Composition

Visualizations in this category highlighted the concentration of various pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5). Interactive charts and graphs helped identify areas with higher pollution levels and periods with significant fluctuations.

Effects of Air Pollution

In this section, I visualized data related to the health impacts of air pollution, including respiratory diseases and hospital admissions. The visualizations underscored the correlation between high pollution levels and adverse health effects, emphasizing the need for stringent air quality regulations.

Modes of Transport

This category examined the relationship between transportation modes and air quality. Visualizations showed the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality, highlighting the benefits of sustainable transport options like cycling and public transit in reducing pollution.

# ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS

1. Targeted Emission Controls: Implement stricter emission controls in high-emission areas such as the Upper West Side and Central Harlem. Focus on reducing NO2 emissions from boilers.

2. Enhance Vehicle Emission Standards: Given the high emissions from cars, particularly in Stuyvesant Town and Turtle Bay, policies to enforce stricter vehicle emission standards and promote electric vehicles could significantly reduce pollution.

3. Health-Focused Policies: Address the high incidence of asthma and deaths due to PM2.5 by increasing air quality monitoring and healthcare resources in affected areas. Implement public awareness campaigns about the health risks of air pollution.

4. Continuous Monitoring and Reporting: Maintain robust monitoring systems to track air quality trends and identify emerging issues promptly. Regular public reporting can enhance transparency and drive community engagement.

5. Learn from Low Emission Areas: Study the strategies used in Borough Park to maintain low emission levels and replicate these best practices in higher emission areas.

6. Encourage Public Transportation: Promote public transportation options and infrastructure to reduce the number of cars on the road, thereby decreasing overall emissions.

By addressing these key areas, we can work towards a healthier environment and mitigate the adverse health effects of air pollution. Continued vigilance and proactive policy-making are essential to sustain the improvements observed in recent years.
